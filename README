MENU:
* xorhash.py -- XOR hash function and testing utilites (complete)
* xorsim.py -- graphical bacterial XOR hash simulation (in progress)

TODO:
* finish xorsim

To run the xorhash run the following python code:
  import xorhash
  xorhash.check()

The above code will run the hash function on all possibly bytes with all possible keys in both left -> right and right -> left directions and check for duplicates in order to validate the 1:1 in/out (no collisions).

To run xorsim, execute it with python -- make sure you have pygame installed. It currently doesn't do very much.
